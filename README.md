# esx_checkin
This is my first ever script, so it's bad coded. So please don't be to harsh on me, although, both negative and positive feedback is extremely helpful and appreciated.
esx_checkin allows police officers to check on/off duty, when you check in, you recieve some weapons, a policebadge, body armor, police outfit and the police job. When you check out, the weapons gets removed, your policebadge gets removed, body armor gets taken off, outfit gets reverted to your original one, and your job changes to off-duty police. When you use your policebadge, you get the option to inspect your badge and to show it to the closest person.
